# MyUnrealGameProject
Beginner-level Unreal Engine project demonstrating basic gameplay mechanics, interactions, and level design.
Basic Unreal Engine Game Project

This repository contains the source files for my early-stage Unreal Engine game project, created as part of my learning journey as a beginner game developer. The project focuses on building core gameplay fundamentals while exploring Unreal Engine workflows in both Blueprints and C++.

Overview:

This project represents the foundational systems I developed while learning how to build simple gameplay interactions, manage levels, and structure an Unreal Engine project properly for version control.

Although it is not a complete game, it includes the essential building blocks that will serve as the basis for future development and experimentation.

What I Built:

Basic level design and environment setup

Simple character movement and interaction mechanics

Introductory gameplay logic using Blueprints and/or C++

Core mechanics such as:

*Pickups

*Basic triggers

*Environment interactions

*Proper Unreal Engine project organization (Source, Content, Config)

Purpose of This Project:

The main goal of this project is to learn and understand:

How Unreal Engine handles Actors, Components, and Levels

How to combine Blueprint scripting with C++ programming

How to create simple gameplay interactions

How to properly structure an Unreal Engine project for Git and version control

How to build repeatable workflows for expanding a game over time

This project serves as a stepping stone for developing more advanced mechanics and systems in the future.

Why This Repository Exists?

I created this repository to:

*Track my progress as a beginner Unreal Engine developer

*Share my work publicly for feedback and learning

*Practice maintaining a clean code and asset structure

*Learn proper GitHub workflow for Unreal Engine projects

*Continue extending the project as my skills grow

*It is also part of my portfolio as I continue learning game development.

Project Structure

The repository includes:

/Content – Maps, Blueprints, materials, models, and assets

/Config – Project and engine configuration files

.uproject – Required file to open the project in Unreal Engine

Folders such as Intermediate, Binaries, Saved, and DerivedDataCache are intentionally excluded to keep the repository clean and lightweight.

How to Open the Project:

Clone or download the repository

Open the .uproject file in the compatible version of Unreal Engine

Allow Unreal Engine to rebuild project files if requested

Press Play to test the project in the editor

Future Plans:

Add more complex gameplay mechanics

Introduce AI behavior and animations

Improve level design and create additional environments

Integrate C++ gameplay systems

Optimize project structure as it grows

Feedback:

As a beginner developer, I welcome suggestions, code reviews, or ideas that could help me improve and learn faster. Feel free to open issues, submit pull requests, or share feedback.
